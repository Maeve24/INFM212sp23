		<h3> About The Me</h3>

<img src = "Me.jpg"/>

<p> Hello! My name is Jayda. I am twenty-three years old and a junior here majoring in health informatics.
Although relatively speaking, I am still a child in the informatics world, I have learned many new things that have piqued my interest.
For example, I enjoy working with databases and coding queries. One interesting fact about me is that I am just now learning to roller skate.
I'm terrible at it, but it's fun. Furthermore, I am a disability advocate, a single mom of three dogs named Hermione, Scout, & Hana, and a member of NSHS.
I look forward to progressing my education with you all! </p>
